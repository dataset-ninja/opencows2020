**OpenCow2020: Visual Identification of Individual Holstein Friesian Cattle via Deep Metric Learning** is a dataset for object detection and identification tasks. It is used in the livestock industry. 

The dataset consists of 11779 images with 13026 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*cow*).

Images in the OpenCow2020 dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 4740 (40% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *detection_and_localisation* (7043 images), *identification-train* (4240 images), and *identification-test* (496 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 2 detection_and_localisation subsets: ***non-synthetic*** (3707 images) and ***synthetic*** (3336 images). Additionally, in *identification-test* and *identification-train* splits information about ***cow_id*** and data ***source*** is provided. The dataset was released in 2020 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">University of Bristol, UK</span>.
